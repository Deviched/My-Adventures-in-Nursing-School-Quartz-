65 Questions
# <font color="#fbd5b5">What are some patient instructions before a TURP procedure?</font>

They will have a catheter installed to drain out any urine before operation and administer antibiotics. 

They will also warn of the patient possible complications after the procedure:
Retrograde ejaculation (semen entering the bladder, and then voided out)

NSAIDs or antipyretic drugs for fever
Adequate fluid intake 
# <font color="#fbd5b5">What is the reason in administering erythropoietin for end stage renal disease?</font>

The kidneys normally produce erythropoietin hormone to create more red blood cells. With the destruction of the kidneys in end stage renal disease, the kidneys cannot perform this function anymore

Administered erythropoietin is needed to maintain body functions

DO NOT PERFORM BLOOD TRANSFUSION
# <font color="#fbd5b5">What are the two major dialysis? How do you know if they are functioning properly?</font>

Peritoneal dialysis - uses the lining of the abdomen to filter blood
Hemodialysis - needs access to large vessel (like radial artey)

You need to be able to feel the "thrill" or hear the "bruit" due to high velocity.
# <font color="#fbd5b5">What lab value is most concerning for a patient on end stage renal disease?</font>

DI is the injury to the pitutary gland or hypothalamus that decreased ADH (antidiuretic hormone) or vasopressin. The loss of ADH means the body loses control over its ability to hold in water.

I**t manifests as large >250ml/hr urine outputs with lowered specific gravity. Thirst will increase to make up the loss.**

Treatment involves replacing the lost ADH, ensure fluid replacement. Medication includes:

Always monitor for dehydration and constantly I/O

# <font color="#fbd5b5">What is the major electrolyte imbalance for Addison’s disease? </font>

Addison's disease is when the adrenal glands don't function at intended capacity; this leads to decreased cortisol and aldosterone levels to where the body isn't properly being maintained.

# <font color="#fbd5b5">What are the differences between hypo and hyperthyroidism?</font>

S&S Hypo:
**Intolerance to cold**
Bradycardia (slower than normal heartrate)
**Dry skin, corse hair**
Constipation
**Hoarse voice**

Hyperthyroidism is the overperformence of the thyroid. The body metabolizes too much and it puts the body in a state of haste.

S&S Hyper:
**Heat intolerance**
Fine, soft hair, brittle
Increased desire to eat and drink
Weight loss
Increased idle energy usage
**Increased basal temperature** 
**Goiter** (bulging thyroid)
Buldging eyes (exophthalmos)

# <font color="#fbd5b5">What is thyroid toxicosis and how to treat and help the patient in this hyper/hypothyroidism state?</font>
