# <font color="#e8dbbf">What are the differences between an autoimmune disease and a neurological disease?</font>

**Autoimmune diseases impact tissue**. Inappropriate organ or tissue inflammation.
(Any rheumatic disorder, scleroderma, lupus erythematosus)

**Neurological diseases impact nerves**. Motor issues, cognitive decline, sensory decline.
(any neurological infection, seizure, bell's palsy, encephalitis, guillain-barre, meningitis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, trigeminal neuralgia)
# <font color="#e8dbbf">Can you describe what happens in rheumatoid arthritis, unique traits, and common signs and symptoms?</font>

<font color="#8db3e2">Rheumatoid</font> (rheumatic) - autoimmune disease (white cells attacking healthy cells)
<font color="#8db3e2">Arthritis</font> - Inflammation of one or more joints

This disease is when the immune system attacks the lining of joints and tissue around it. 

A unique and recognizable trait of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the **!!! SYMMETRY OF JOINT INFLAMMATION !!!** (BOTH sides of the body will mirror the afflicted joints). Gross deformities, posture, or gait abnormalities are also to be expected from RA.
# <font color="#e8dbbf">What should you monitor for for a patient being treated with corticosteroids for rheumatoid arthritis?</font>

**Blood sugar.** Corticosteroids can increase insulin resistance and decrease the body's ability to regulate blood sugar effectively. 
# <font color="#e8dbbf">Can you describe what osteoporosis is?</font>

It's a hormonal disease that greatly reduces the bone remodeling process. The destruction of bone is faster than the creation of it, leading to decreased bone mass. 
# <font color="#e8dbbf">What is a goal when it comes to the treatment of osteoporosis?</font>

To strengthen bones.

You can use calcium supplements, vitamin D to absorb more calcium (or sunlight). Weight-bearing exercise is also used as a form of treatment; it builds and maintains bone mass.
- Walking, hiking, weight training, stair climbing, tennis, dancing, yoga
# <font color="#e8dbbf">What are the differences in pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions?</font>

Pharmacological - use of drugs or medications. Some holistic treatments may involve natural medication, which is considered pharmacological treatment.

Non-pharmacological - treatment that does not use medication. It includes lifestyle changes, behavioral therapists, physical therapy.

<font color="#8db3e2">Osteo</font> - greek for bone
<font color="#8db3e2">myle</font> - greek for spinal chord or bone marrow
<font color="#8db3e2">itis</font> - greek for inflammation

Aggressive and prolonged IV antibiotic therapy through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). This treatment can last 4 - 6 weeks, but can last longer, or indefinitely

You need to monitor the peak and trough levels of the antibiotic to avoid adverse effects.

Antibiotic peak: Typically drawn 30 minutes to 2 hours after intravenous (IV) infusion completion.
Antibiotic trough: Measure immediately before next dose
# <font color="#e8dbbf">A patient needs to be on long-term antibiotics. What medical equipment do they need to go home with?</font>

They need to have a central venous access device (CVAD) installed and attached to a vein, and to administer medication, they need to use a provided peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC)
# <font color="#e8dbbf">How does back pain gradually form? How can you educate the patient in preventing back pain?</font>

Most often its due from improper body mechanics (poor posture and form).

Educate the patient on proper body form: having appropriate body weight, proper sleep positioning, firm mattress, cessation of smoking. The patient should be able to recite their teaching of correct body posture.
# <font color="#e8dbbf">What are the signs and symptoms of Parkingson's Disease and what is normal for the disease vs. what needs an intervention?</font>

Common and normal; all symptoms will gradually worsen over time:
- <font color="#953734">T</font>remors

# <font color="#e8dbbf">What medication is used for multiple sclerosis and what do you need to monitor for while using that medication?</font>

<font color="#8db3e2">Sclero</font> - greek from "skleros", meaning hard or hardening
<font color="#8db3e2">osis</font> - medical terminology for abnormal
(destruction of myelin sheaths of the brain and spinal cord)

Corticosteroids are used for treatment for acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis.

# <font color="#e8dbbf">What medication is used for gout? What complications can come from using this medication, and how can you mitigate its adverse effect?</font>

Primary medication for treatment:
**Allopurinol** (Zyloprim) or **Febuxostat** (Uloric) - decreases uric acid production

**These two medications are known to cause the destruction of platelets** (Thrombocytopenia) which can express itself as excessive bleeding or bruising. Monitor blood count regularly and in emergency provide a platelet transfusion

**Probenecid** - increases excretion of uric acid
**AVOID ASPIRIN WITH THIS DRUG!!!** Aspirin competes with probenecid and will reduce its effects.

# <font color="#e8dbbf">Why do patients with systemic lupus erythematosus become more vulnerable to infections?</font>

The immune system is completely dysregulated in this condition (multi-organ inflamed) and is unable to combat real pathogens efficiently **leading to vulnerability to infections, ESPECIALLY PNEUMONIA**

You can recognize an SLE patient getting sick through typical symptoms: fever
# <font color="#e8dbbf">What is a complication of raynaud's phenomenon in the condition scleroderma and its intervention?</font>

Raynaud's phenomenon is the sudden vasospasm of digits; it can cause the fingers and toes to have decreased blood flow when exposed to the cold.

It can lead to lack of circulation and should be intervened by putting warm socks and gloves on the patient. 
# <font color="#e8dbbf">What is the most common anti-inflammatory medication used in rheumatoid arthritis?</font>

Various NSAIDs may be used, including high dosage Aspirin

The full effectiveness of an NSAID may not be immediately felt and typically takes 2 to 3 weeks for the NSAID to be effective for RA

Celecoxib (Celebrex) is also effective as a COX-2 inhibitor for RA pain management
# <font color="#e8dbbf">What are the dietary restrictions of gout?</font>

<font color="#8db3e2">Trigeminal </font>- name for the fifth cranial nerve (sensation in the face and chewing)
<font color="#8db3e2">neuralgia </font>- severe, stabbing, sharp pain

The condition is the 5th cranial nerve (and the 2nd and 3rd branches of it) inappropriately sending pain signals across the face.

A major complication is that the patient may be **reluctant to eat due to pain**. Intervene by providing pain medication (corticosteroid) and proving soft food (but avoid hot or cold food) and suggesting to chew on unaffected side.
# <font color="#e8dbbf">What is meningitis and what are signs and symptoms of it?</font>
