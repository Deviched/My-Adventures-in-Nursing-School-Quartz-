Assess FIRST for INTERVENTION

When providing hygiene care to clients with diabetes mellitus or peripheral vascular disease, the feet would not be soaked and the nails would not be trimmed, and the primary health care provider or a podiatrist would be consulted for foot care if needed.

"Cool, pale, moist" indicates a patient is going into shock
**Hypovolemic shock symptoms include:**
- Breathing faster than normal.
- Feeling confused or anxious.
- Sweating a lot.
- Passing out.
- Having skin that feels cool.
- Feeling weak.
- Having a low temperature and low blood pressure.
- Having a fast pulse.

Call HCP:
Oz saturation <88%
Glasglow scale <8 (sudden drop)

## Drugs
Calcium acetate acts as a phosphate binder, reducing the high serum phosphorous levels commonly found in the client with CKD. 

Losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) used as an antihypertensive agent.

phenytoin 

## Alert
Shellfish allergy (Studies have shown a correlation between shellfish allergies and an allergic reaction to the contrast used in CT scan procedures.) 

Babinski reflex (negative means intact brain stem) 


## VIII. Thrombophlebitis pg.106
A. Description
1. Thrombophlebitis is an infiammation of a vein, often accompanied by clot formation.  
Veins in the legs are affected most commonly.

XVI. Vascular Disorders
A. Venousthrombosis 
Description:
a. Thrombus can be associated with an inflammatory process.
b. When a thrombus develops, inflammation occurs, thickening the vein wall and leading to embolization.

Types
a. Thrombophlebitis: Thrombus associated with vein inflammation
b. Phlebothrombosis: Thrombus without vein inflammation
c. Phlebitis: Vein inflammation associated with invasive procedures, such as IV lines
d. Deep vein thrombophlebitis: More serious than a superficial thrombophlebitis because
of the risk for pulmonary embolism

3.Risk factors for thrombus formation
1. Venous stasis from varicose veins, heart failure, immobility
2. Hypercoagulability disorders
3. Injury to the venous wall from IV injections; administration of vessel irritants (chemo- therapy, hypertonic solutions)
4. Following surgery, particularly orthopedic and abdominal surgery
5. Pregnancy
6. Ulcerative colitis
7. Use of oral contraceptives
8. Certain malignancies
9. Fractures or other injuries of the pelvis or lower extremities

B. Phlebitis
Assessment
1. Red, warm area radiating up the vein and extremity
2. Pain
3. Swelling

2.Interventions
1. Apply warm, moist soaks as prescribed to di- late the vein and promote circulation (assess temperature of soak before applying).
2. Assess for signs of complications such as tissue necrosis, infection, or pulmonary embolus.

C. Deep vein thrombophlebitis
1. Assessment
a. Calf or groin tenderness or pain with or with- out swelling

b. PositiveHomans’signmaybenoted;howev- er, false-positive results are common, so this is not a reliable assessment measure.
c. Warm skin that is tender to touch 

2.Interventions
a. Provide bed rest if prescribed.  
b. Elevate the affected extremity above the levelof the heart as prescribed.  
c. Avoid using the knee gatchora pillow under the knees.  
d. Do not massage the extremity.
e. Provide thigh-high or knee-high antiembolism stockings as prescribed to reduce venous stasis and assist in the venous return of blood to the heart; teach how to apply and remove stockings.
f. Administer intermittent or continuous warm, moist compresses as prescribed.
g. Palpate the site gently, monitoring for warmth and edema.
h. Measure and record the circumferences of the thighs and calves.
i. Monitor for shortness of breath and chest pain, which can indicate pulmonary emboli. j. Administer thrombolytic therapy (tissue plasminogen activator) if prescribed, which must be initiated within 5 days after the onset of symptoms.
k. Administer heparin therapy as prescribed to prevent enlargement of the existing clot and prevent the formation of new clots.
l. Monitor activated partial thromboplastin time during heparin therapy.
m. Administer warfarin as prescribed following heparin therapy when the symptoms of deep vein thrombophlebitis have resolved.
n. Monitor prothrombin time and international normalized ratio during warfarin therapy.  
o. Monitor for the adverse effects associated with anticoagulant therapy. p. Client education (Box 53.9)

## XXV. Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (Hyperplasia) pg.804

A. Description  
1. Benign prostatic hypertrophy (benign prostatichyperplasia; BPH) is a slow enlargement of the prostate gland, with hypertrophy and hyperplasia of normal tissue.
2. Enlargement compresses the urethra, resulting in partial or complete obstruction.
3. Usually occurs in those older than 50 years 

B. Assessment
1. Diminished size and force of urinary stream (early sign of BPH)
2. Urinary urgency and frequency  
3. Nocturia  
4. Inability to start (hesitancy) or continue a urinary stream  
5. Feelings of incomplete bladder emptying  
6. Postvoid dribbling from overflow incontinence (later sign)  
7. Urinary retention and bladder distention 8. Hematuria  
8. Urinary stasis and UTIs
9. Dysuria and bladder pain

C. Interventions
1. Encourage fluid intake of up to 2000 to 3000 mL/day unless contraindicated.  
2. Prepare for urinary catheterization to drain the bladder and prevent distention.
3. Avoid administering medications that cause urinary retention, such as anticholinergics, antihistamines, decongestants, and antidepressants. Administer medications as prescribed to shrink the prostate gland and improve urine flow. 
4. Administer medications as prescribed to relax prostatic smooth muscle and improve urine flow.
5. Instruct the client to decrease intake of caffeine and artificial sweeteners and limit spicy or acidic foods.  
6. Instruct the client to follow a timed voiding schedule.
7. Prepare the client for surgery or invasive procedures as prescribed (see Chapter 45, Figs. 45.6 and 45.7).

D. Surgical interventions and postoperative care (see Chapter 45)

E. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) may be performed for palliation in prostate cancer clients (Fig. 45.6).
1. The procedure involves insertion of a scope into the urethra to excise prostatic tissue.
2. Monitor for hemorrhage; bleeding is common following TURP.
3. Postoperative continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) may be prescribed, which prevents catheter obstruction from clots.
4. Monitor output and for obstruction; irrigate per prescription, and notify the surgeon immediately if obstruction does not resolve.
5. Assess for signs of transurethral resection syndrome, which includes signs of cerebral edema and in- creased intracranial pressure, such as increased blood pressure, bradycardia, confusion, disorientation, muscle twitching, visual disturbances, and nausea and vomiting.
6. Antispasmodics may be prescribed for bladder spasm.
7. Instruct the client to monitor and report drib- bling or incontinence postoperatively, and teach perineal exercises.
8. Sterility is possible following the surgical procedure.

Postoperative interventions
1. Monitor vital signs.
2. Monitor urinary output and urine for hemorrhage or clots.
3. Increase fluids to 2400 to 3000 mL/day, unless contraindicated.
4. Monitor for arterial bleeding as evidenced by bright red urine with numerous clots; if it oc- curs, increase CBI and notify the surgeon immediately.
5. Monitor for venous bleeding as evidenced by burgundy-colored urine output; if it occurs, in- form the surgeon, who may apply traction on the catheter.
6. Monitor output and for obstruction; irrigate per prescription, and notify the surgeon immediately if obstruction does not resolve.
7. Monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.
8. Expect red to light pink urine for 24 hours, turning to amber in 3 days.
9. Ambulate the client as early as possible and as soon as urine begins to clear in color.
10. Inform the client that a continuous feeling of an urge to void is normal.
11. Instruct the client to avoid attempts to void around the catheter, because this will cause bladder spasms.
12. Administer antibiotics, analgesics, stool softeners, and antispasmodics as prescribed.
13. Monitor the three-way urinary catheter, which usually has a 30- to 45-mL retention balloon.
14. Maintain CBI with sterile bladder irrigation so- lution as prescribed to keep the catheter free of obstruction and keep the urine pink in color (Box 45.17).

* ! Following TURP, monitor for transurethral resection syndrome or severe hyponatremia (water intoxication) caused by the excessive absorption of bladder irrigation during surgery. Signs include altered mental status, bradycardia, increased blood pressure, and confusion.



## XIV. Parkinson’s Disease pg.868

A. Description  
1. A degenerative disease caused by the depletion of dopamine, which interferes with the inhibition of excitatory impulses, resulting in a dys-function of the extrapyramidal system.
2. It is a slow, progressive disease that results in a crippling disability.
3. The debilitation can result in falls, self-care debilitation, failure of body systems, and depression.
4. Mental deterioration occurs late in the disease. 
   
B. Assessment
1. Bradykinesia, abnormal slowness of movement, and sluggishness of physical and mental responses
2. Akinesia  
3. Monotonous speech  
4. Handwriting that becomes progressively smaller

Adult—Neurological
1. Tremors in hands and fingers at rest (pill roll- ing)
2. Tremors increasing when fatigued and decreasing with purposeful activity or sleep
3. Rigidity with jerky movements
4. Restlessness and pacing
5. Blank facial expression; masklike face
6. Drooling
7. Diffiiculty swallowing and speaking
8. Loss of coordination and balance
9. Shuffiing steps, stooped position, and propulsive gait

C. Interventions
1. Assess neurological status.
2. Assess ability to swallow and chew.
3. Provide high-calorie, high-protein, high-fiber soft diet with small, frequent feedings.
4. Increase fluid intake to 2000 mL/day.
5. Monitor for constipation.
6. Promote independence along with safety measures.
7. Avoid rushing the client with activities.
8. Assist with ambulation, and provide assistive devices.
9. Instruct the client to rock back and forth to initiate movement.
10. Instruct the client to wear low-heeled shoes.
11. Encourage the client to lift the feet when walking and to avoid prolonged sitting.
12. Provide a firm mattress and position the client prone, without a pillow, to facilitate proper posture.
13. Instruct in proper posture by teaching the client to hold the hands behind the back to keep the spine and neck erect.
14. Promote physical therapy and rehabilitation.
15. Medication therapy for Parkinson’s disease is usually determined by shared decision-making, as side effects of drug therapy can affect quality of life.
16. Administer antiparkinsonian medications to increase the level of dopamine in the CNS.
17. Instruct the client to consult with the PHCP regarding foods high in vitamin B6, because they block the effects of antiparkinsonian medications.
18. Avoid the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, because they will precipitate hypertensive crisis.
19. See Chapter 60 regarding medication to treat Parkinson’s disease.
