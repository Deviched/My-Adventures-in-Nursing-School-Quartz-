- EPS are drug-induced movement disorders that include various types of abnormal involuntary movements.

**Signs and Symptoms:**
1. **Dystonia:**
    - Muscle spasms and contractions, often involving the neck, face, and back.
2. **Akathisia:**
    - A feeling of inner restlessness and an uncontrollable need to be in constant motion.
3. **Parkinsonism:**
    - Symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease, including tremors, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, and postural instability.
4. **Tardive Dyskinesia:**
    - Involuntary, repetitive body movements, often involving the face, tongue, and limbs.

**Causes:**
- EPS are commonly associated with the use of antipsychotic medications, especially first-generation (typical) antipsychotics. These medications block dopamine receptors, which can lead to an imbalance in the brain's motor control pathways.

**Treatment:**
1. **Medication Adjustments:**
    - Lowering the dose of the causative antipsychotic or switching to a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic, which generally have a lower risk of EPS.
2. **Medications to Manage EPS:**
    - **Anticholinergics:** Such as benztropine or trihexyphenidyl, used to manage symptoms of parkinsonism and dystonia.
    - **Beta-blockers:** Such as [[Propranolol]], often effective for akathisia.
    - **Benzodiazepines:** Such as [[Lorazepam]], may provide relief for akathisia and acute dystonic reactions.
3. **Tardive Dyskinesia Treatment:**
    - Specific medications like deutetrabenazine or valbenazine may be used to manage tardive dyskinesia.

**Monitoring and Prevention:**

- Regular monitoring for signs of EPS in patients on antipsychotic medications.
- Using the lowest effective dose of antipsychotics and considering atypical antipsychotics to minimize the risk.
