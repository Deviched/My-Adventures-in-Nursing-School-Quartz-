    - [[Valproate]] (Depakene)
    - [[Divalproex]] (Depakote)

- **Typical Antipsychotics** (Used during manic phase)
	- [[Chlorpromazine]] (Thorazine)
	- [[Haloperidol]] (Haldol)
- **Atypical Antipsychotics**:
    - [[Olanzapine]] (Zyprexa)
    - [[Quetiapine]] (Seroquel)

        - **Side Effects**: Can cause a serious rash (Stevens-Johnson syndrome).

### **Depression**
**Depression Summary**: Characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest, and other symptoms. Antidepressants work by increasing levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine in the brain.
	
- **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**:
    - [[Fluoxetine]] (Prozac)
    - [[Paroxetine]] (Paxil)
    - [[Sertraline]] (Zoloft)
    - **Side Effects**: Generally well-tolerated but can cause sexual side effects, weight gain, and insomnia.
- **Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)**:
    - [[Duloxetine]] (Cymbalta)
    - [[Venlafaxine]] (Effexor)
    - **Side Effects**: Similar to SSRIs but may also increase blood pressure.
- **Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)**:
    - [[Amitriptyline]] (Elavil)
    - [[Clomipramine]] (Anafranil)
    - [[Nortriptyline]] (Pamelor)
    - **Side Effects**: More side effects than SSRIs or SNRIs, including dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and drowsiness. Can be cardiotoxic in overdose.
- **Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)**:
    - [[Phenelzine]] (Nardil)
    - [[Tranylcypromine]] (Parnate)
    - **Side Effects**: Have serious dietary restrictions (tyramine) and can interact dangerously with many medications.
- **Atypical Antidepressants**:
    - [[Bupropion]] (Wellbutrin)
    - [[Mirtazapine]] (Remeron)
