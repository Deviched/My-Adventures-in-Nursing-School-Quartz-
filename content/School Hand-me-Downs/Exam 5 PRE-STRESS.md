* URINARY SYSTEM <font color="#c00000">(Ch.45)</font>
* GLANDS OF THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM <font color="#c00000">(Ch.45)</font>
	* What is the purpose of the endocrine system?
		* Vital role in orchestrating cellular interactions, metabolism, growth, reproduction, aging, and response to adverse condition.
		* It acts based off of negative feedback mechanism
		* Manages these hormones:
		  Amines and amino acids
		  Peptides, polypeptides, proteins, and glycoproteins: acts on cell surface
		  Steroids: acts inside the cell
		  Fatty acid derivatives
* THYROID GLAND <font color="#c00000">(Ch.45)</font>
	* What does the thyroid do?
		* Plays a major role in metabolism, growth, and development of the human body.
		* Thyroid hormones - T3, T4, calcitonin. **Iodine is contained in the thyroid** hormone; thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary controls the release of thyroid hormone
	* What are relevant diagnostic test when finding for thyroid related issues?
		* ==Thyroid stimulating hormone== (TSH) - primary lab for hypo/hyper thyroids. If the thyroid is underperforming, the pituitary gland will try to release more TSH to stimulate more thyroid hormones. **High TSH = Low thyroid performance (HYPOthyroidism)** and vice versa. 
		* ==Free T4== - amount of T4 enzyme that is not bound to proteins. Also helps in diagnosing hypo/hyper thyroidism. **Low T4 = indicator that thyroid is underperforming, and vice versa**
		* T3 and T4 (bound) - also related to thyroid over/under performance
		* T3 Resin Uptake - how well proteins can bind to a hormone. Not used as much as free T4 tests
		* ==Thyroid antibodies== - It's VERY abnormal for thyroid hormones to have antibodies on them and **is greatly indicative of an autoimmune condition relating to the destruction of thyroid hormones**
		* Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU) - determines if there's enough iodine being absorbed by the thyroid in order to function. This can be a cause of hyperthyroidism or other abnormal thyroid tissue
		* ==Fine needle Biopsy== - Small needle used to extract cells from the thyroid gland. It's used to determine the nature of thyroid nodules or growths (benign vs. malignant)
		* ==Thyroid scan/radioscan/or scintiscan== - images the thyroid and identifies areas of over or underactive performance
		* ==Serum Thyroglobulin== - elevated levels suggest thyroid cancer or thyrotoxicosis (excess hormone activity)
	* What does Hyperthyroidism mean?
		* When there is too much thyroid hormones in the body.
		* More often in women
		* Highest frequency between ages 20 to 40
	* What can cause Hyperthyroidism?
		* **Graves' disease -- MOST COMMON**
		* Toxic nodular goiter (malignant node)
		* Thyroiditis (inflamed thyroid)
		* Excess iodine intake (overly boosts performance)
		* Pituitary tumors
		* Thyroid cancer
	* Thyrotoxicosis' relation to hyperthyroidism
		* Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis usually occur together
		* Thyrotoxicosis is the clinical state of inappropriately high levels of circulating thyroid hormones
		* It creates the same physiologic effects/clincal syndromes of hypermetabolism (elevated resting energy expenditure)
	* What is acute Thyrotoxicosis?
		* Excessive amounts of hormones released
		* LIFE THREATENING!
		* Results from stressors: anything that influences the thyroid to make more hormones
		* Thyroidectomy (removal of thyroid gland) patients at risk 
	* Clinical manifestations of acute Thyroxtocicosis
		* **Severe tachycardia, heart failure**
		* Shock
		* **Hyperthermia (up to 106F or 41.1C)**
		* Agitation
		* **Seizures**
		* **Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea**
		* Delirium, coma
	* **What is Graves' disease?**
		* The thyroid gland overproduces hormones. It's an autoimmune disease **(BUT NOT IN THE WAY YOU THINK)**; women are 5x more than men to develop Graves' disease
		* **Antibodies accidentally mimic as TSH by binding itself to TSH**. It changes the role of an antibody to act as an additional TSH enzyme
		* The production of "fake TSH" (thyroid sitmulating immunoglobulins) is uncontrolled as the immune system will now generate TSIs. **The immune system does not respond to the pituitary gland to stop TSH (TSI) production, but the thyroid will and real TSH levels are normally low in graves' disease**
	* What are clinical manifestations of Graves' disease?
		* Symptoms related to elevated thyroid hormones: increased metabolism and increased tissue sensitivity to sympathetic nervous system stimulation **(the body overreacts and overspends energy)** because of increased thyroid hormones
		* Goiter (enlarged thyroid gland)
		* ==Ophthalmopathy== - Abnormal eye appearance or function
		* ==Exophthalmos== - increase in fat deposits and fluid; **eyeballs forced outward**

* PARATHYROID GLAND <font color="#c00000">(Ch.45)</font>
	* What does the parathyroid do?
		* Produces the parathyroid hormone, which plays a key role in the regulation of serum CA levels in the blood. Small changes in Ca levels can cause muscle and nerve problems
		* ! **PTH** - **P**uts **T**he calcium **H**igh
	* What does calcium do?
		* Maintain bones
		* Helps facilitate muscle contraction
		* Helps make blood clots
		* Helps release neurotransmitters in nerve cells to muscles
		* Involved in generating electrical impulses to govern heart contraction
		* Low calcium = neuromuscular activity is less controlled (and is more excited) = neurons become unstable and fire spontaneously = involuntary contraction of the muscles = tetany (invuluntary muscle contraction)
	* What happens in hyperparathyroidism?
		* Parathyroids create too much PTH and sucks out the Ca+ from other sources to put in blood
		* Stones - kidney stones
		* Groans - broken bones
		* Moans - constipation
		* Apathy
		* Fatigue
		* Muscle weakness
		* Nausea and vomiting
		* Hypertension
		* Cardiac dysrhythmias
	* How do you manage hyperparathyroidism?
		* Hydration therapy 2000> mL fluid daily
		* Maintain mobility to prevent Ca loss in bones
		* Don't restrict calcium in diet
		* ! Report tingling around the lips (hypercalcemia) to HCP
		* Parathyroidectomy removes excess thyroid tissue (MONITOR FOR AIRWAY/FLUID VOLUME STATUS/MOBILITY/DIET/CONSTIPATION)
	* What happens in hypoparathyroidism?
		* Not enough Ca is in the blood for the body to function normally
		* The parathyroid isn't producing enough PTH; it could be from abnormal parathyroid development, destruction of parathyroid glands, or vitamin D deficiency
		* ! **Tetany**
		* Numbness
		* Tingling in extremities
		* Stiffness of hands and feet
		* ! **Bronchospasm**
		* ! **Larynheal spasm**
		* Carpopedal spasm

	* How do you manage hypothyroidism?
		* 
* ADRENAL GLAND <font color="#c00000">(Ch.45)</font>
	* What do the adrenal gland do?
		* These hormones regulate the processing of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates by the human body. **They also play a role in maintaining normal stress cycle**
		* It can be divided into three classes:
		* 1.) Mineralocorticoids - regulate the concentration of electrolytes circulating in the blood. **Aldosterone** functions to increased blood sodium levels and low potassium levels targeting the kidneys
		* 2.) Glucocorticoids - processes proteins, fats, carbohydrates
		* 3.) Androgens - sex hormones (estrogen, testosterone)
