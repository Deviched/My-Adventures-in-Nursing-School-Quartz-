# <font color="#eedba7">A patient with peritonitis has an ongoing sepsis condition that is worsening into sepsis shock. What are indicators that sepsis is worsening?</font>

Raised WBC, respiratory distress, tachycardia, altered mental status, significant drop in BP. **Perfusion will worsen.** Generally all important lab values will drop, except for certain values that correlate with organs (serum bilirubin, liver enzymes) which may rise as the organ fails and deplete content into the bloodstream. 
# <font color="#eedba7">A patient with peritonitis with sepsis is entering sepsis shock. What is your first immediate intervention as a nurse?</font>

**Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation.** Sepsis shock dramatically impairs perfusion.
# <font color="eedba7">A patient is discovered to have an infection. What is your response as a nurse?</font>

Begin antibiotics.
# <font color="#eedba7">Which inflammatory bowel disease can lead to urinary tract infections and fistulas?</font>

Crohn's disease.
# <font color="#eedba7">What are the 4 proton pump inhibitors used for treating peptic ulcer disease and their side effects and risks?</font>

Nexium, Prevacid, Prilosec, Protnix (NPPP-- I C. no Diff) 

**PPI usage is associated with increased risk of developing a C.Diff  infection because of decreased stomach acid activity (which normally protects against C.Diff bacteria)**

The side effects of PPIs include headaches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. They only need to be administered once a day, 30 mins before the first meal of the day.
# <font color="#eedba7">A patient with peptic ulcers is being administered a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). When should you administer this medication?</font>

**Take these 30 minutes before the first meal of the day** so that the medication can be absorbed properly and inhibit the protein pump before it is stimulated by food. This only needs to be administered once a day.

The side effects of PPIs include headaches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
# <font color="#eedba7">You need to administer medication through a nasogastric tube. What should you do first before administering?</font>

**The NG needs to be clamped if the NG tube is on suction for 30 mins after adminstering.** This ensures the medication doesn't accidentally get suctioned out. Be sure to flush the tube to fully push through the medication. 
# <font color="#eedba7">A patient with a peptic ulcer diagnosis is producing tarry, black stools and other indicators that an ulcer is bleeding. What is your first intervention at this discovery?</font>

**NPO, IV fluid replacement.** The patient will rapidly lose fluid balance and we need to avoid irritating the stomach until the hemorrhage is treated.
# <font color="#eedba7">Describe the triple-drug therapy method of treating an H. Pylori infection</font>

It's a method of treatment that relies on one proton pump inhibitor and several compatible antibiotics interacting (strengthening each other) 

Any compatible PPI (NPPP) can be used + any 2 combination of these antibiotics: Amoxicillin, biaxin, tetracycline, flagyl, bismuth

This treatment is expected to be a 7 - 14 day duration. The eradication rate of triple-drug is 70 - 85%.
# <font color="#eedba7">What medications can cause gastritis?</font>

**NSAIDS** (ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen) can irritate the stomach lining

**Cortosteroids**: long term use gradually reduces the stomach's protective lining
# <font color="#eedba7">What are expected diagnostic findings when the GI is actively bleeding?</font>

Lowered hematocrit and hemoglobin, raised WBC

Black tarry stools or stools with blood on them
Vomiting blood (metabolic alkalosis)
Abdominal pain
# <font color="#eedba7">A new patient was admitted with GI problems. What interventions would you make right away?</font>

Start NPO and IV fluids. 
# <font color="#eedba7">When should you administer a proton pump inhibitor? What are side effects of a PPI?</font>

For either PPIs of nexium or omeprazole, they both need only to be applied once a day, **30 minutes before the first meal of the day** by mouth (oral).
# <font color="#eedba7">When should you administer an antacid? What are the side effects?</font>

Primarily used to treat GERD, but also functions in relieving symptoms in other GI disorders.

**For either maalox or mylanta antacids, you need to take them 1-3 hours after food**. They neutralize the acid as the meal becomes sufficiently digested.

BE CAREFUL WITH PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY DISORDERS OR KIDNEY STONES. Antacids can worsen kidney function. Do NOT give an antacid within 2 hours of any other drug.

**Other side effects include an increase in BP, diarrhea (maalox), and constipation (amphojel)**. Long term use can cause alkalosis. 
# <font color="#eedba7">What are some patient teachings that you should educate to a patient who was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux (GERD)?</font>

**High protein, low fat diet** (proteins are less acidic and less likely to trigger acid reflux)
**Small and frequent meals**
**Reduce weight if needed**
**Reduce stress**

AVOID: Alcohol, smoking, eating before bed, and acidic (sugary, junk, citrus) foods

**Position bed 30 degrees up after eating while sleeping**
**Take PPI before the first meal of the day**
# <font color="#eedba7">What are some examples of a clear liquid for a diet?</font>

Anything that is a liquid or becomes fully liquid and leaves little residue in the digestive system:
Water, fruit juice (NO pulp), coffee or tea (without dairy products), cup broth, gelatin, ice pops, soft drinks.

Milk is NOT a clear liquid as it contains proteins and fats.
# <font color="#eedba7">What does post-op care for a gastric bypass/bariatric surgery consist of?</font>

Monitor vital signs
Early ambulation
Keep bed elevated by 30-45 degrees to decrease abdominal pressure and increase lung expansion
**TURN, COUGH, DEEP BREATHE, INCENTIVE SPIROMETRY**
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: sequential compression devices (SCD) and LMW heparin
Maintain IV fluids as ordered
Pain medication through patient controlled analgesia (PCA)

DO NOT MANIPULATE OR IRRIGATE NG TUDE UNLESS ORDERED. This may disrup the suture lines or anastomosis (cross connection)
# <font color="#eedba7">What would the post-op diet be for a patient who came out of a gastric bypass/bariatric surgery?</font>

Initially, sugar free clear liquids. Progress diet to measured high protein liquid diets (protein shakes, milk).

Do NOT consume liquids with solid food together. Teach the patient to eat slowly and to STOP when they feel full.

A typical meal schedule is 6 meals a day, low carb and fat, high protein. Some fluid restriction may be needed.
# <font color="#eedba7">A patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). What is one crucial thing you need to monitor if a patient is on TPN treatment?</font>

**Check their blood sugar.** The patient can't control the amount of glucose they consume through TPN and can easily become either hypo or hyperglycemic
# <font color="#eedba7">A patient on total parenteral nutrition has their nutritional bag ran out and the next bag is unavailable right now. What should you do?</font>

**Replace the empty nutritional bag with a bag of dextrose 10%** and run at the same rate as the original TPN until the next nutritional bag is ready. This provides a source of glucose for the patient in-between nutritional bags.
# <font color="#eedba7">For a patient with a nasogastric tube, what do we need to do before they are fed?</font>

**Check the residual to make sure they're not being overfed.** If the residual is over 500ml, HOLD the feeding.

**If they can feed, hold the bed at a 45 degree angle** so they don't aspirate while feeding.
# <font color="#eedba7">You have several patients to take care of. Which should you prioritize?</font>

The patient with the most threat to their ABCs
# <font color="#eedba7">How should you prepare a patient for a CT scan?</font>

Patient will be NPO and will have fasted for several hours before the procedure. They'll consume a chalky substance before the scan. 

Educate the patient that they may feel nauseated during the scan and the fast is to prevent them from throwing up during the scan. After the scan, advice them to overhydrate to remove the chalky substance through their kidneys.
# <font color="#eedba7">What is a nutritional bag for TPN and why would we need to monitor the blood sugar of a TPN patient?</font>

A nutritional bag is composed of dextrose, protein (amino acids), electrolytes, vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and insulin. You need to monitor for their glucose as the patient cannot control their glucose intake on a nutritional bag. Any patient can become temporarily diabetic, especially during the administering period
# <font color="#eedba7">How do we check for the patency (open, unobstructed) of an NG tube?</font>

**You irrigate it with saline.** Do NOT force the saline through if it is obstructed.
# <font color="#eedba7">A patient seems to be sleeping while on an assisted breathing machine. What should you do to check up on them?</font>

Attempt to rouse them awake for response. 
# <font color="#eedba7">What are the precautions to C. Diff?</font>

PATIENTS REQUIRE ISOLATION!

Contact precautions; use gloves and gowns. You MUST use handwashing hygiene; alcohol based sanitizers will not kill C. Diff.
# <font color="#eedba7">Patients after any abdominal surgery need to cough as a part of their post op care. What would dissuade patients from coughing? Why would they need to cough?</font>

They need to cough to prevent atelectasis: collapsed lung. 

Patients may be reluctant to cough due to abdominal pain. Offer to give them pain medication or to advice them to splint to cough.
# <font color="#eedba7">A patient wants to eat after their procedure. What should you do next for the patient?</font>

**Check their gag reflex if they're able to swallow.** If they're not strictly ordered a specific diet, offer them food as tolerated. 
# <font color="#eedba7">What are some patient safety guidelines for a patient on TPN?</font>

Patient needs to be elevated by 45 degrees to prevent aspiration
Check residuals every 4 hours; if it's over 500ml, HOLD feedings
Clamp the NG for 30 mins after medication administration if NG is on suction
Feeding tube needs to be placed 8 hours before the next bolus/med
Monitor for blood sugar and lungs (aspiration, fluid overload)
# <font color="#eedba7">How would a patient be eligible for bariatric surgery?</font>

If their BMI is >40 or >35 with obesity related comorbid.
# <font color="#eedba7">What are immediate interventions to a patient suffering from acute diverticulitis?</font>

They need to be NPO and placed on IV fluids and antibiotics.

Decrease intra-abdominal pressure by advising the patient to not strain while eliminating, no bending or lifting, no constrictive clothing, and to reduce weight.
# <font color="#eedba7">What is important when taking care of a patient with an ostomy bag?</font>

That their skin stays intact. The skin needs to have the adhesive skin barrier around the stoma from the ostomy bag. Minimal skin should be exposed to the stoma to avoid breakdown from gastral mucus.

Use soap and water to wipe away stoma residue and apply a protective skin barrier when you change ostomy bags.
# <font color="#eedba7">How would you know if a patient is constipated?</font>

The absence or infrequent stool patterns. The stools may also be difficult to pass or be retained in the rectum.
# <font color="#eedba7">What does a healthy stoma look like?</font>

Red and beefy; bright and moist. This is an indicator of good circulation. 

A dusky blue color indicates  ischemia (reduced blood flow)
# <font color="#eedba7">A patient is admitted in the ER with severe RLQ abdominal pain that's been ruled as the appendix. What would've happened if the appendix stayed untreated if the patient wasn't admitted?</font>

Appendicitis may lead to a rupture and spread infection to the belly lining, leading to peritonitis. Peritonitis can lead to sepsis and sepsis shock, which completely inflames the body, leading to critically reduced blood blow (threat of organ failure)

An emergency surgery would be needed
# <font color="#eedba7">What is a method of "training" a patient with incontinence issues in order to treat it?</font>

By scheduling bowel movements. This makes the bowel patterns more predictable and easier to control for the patient.
# <font color="#eedba7">What is the most common source of ulcers?</font>

H. Pylori (Helicobacter pylori) bacteria
# <font color="#eedba7">The vital signs of a patient with peptic ulcer disease are falling. What is your intervention?</font>

NPO, NG tube to suction (empty stomach, less irritation, improved healing), and IV fluids.

Administer medication as ordered and keep monitoring vital signs.
# <font color="#eedba7">What stomach condition is most prone for bloody diarrhea?</font>

Ulcerative Colitis
# <font color="#eedba7">What lab values would be most prominent for a patient with peritonitis?</font>

Raised WBC and an imbalance of electrolytes
High temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate
Distended abdomen
# <font color="#eedba7">What should be the expected findings of end-stage liver cirrhosis?</font>

A high elevation of ammonia and changes to neurologic and mental responsiveness as the ammonia reaches the brain

Asterixis (flapping tremors)
Impairment in writing
Foul breath
-
Decreased serum albumin and K
Increased INR
Increased ammonia
Increased biliribin
# <font color="#eedba7">What will you administer for a cirrhosis patient whose ammonia levels are rising?</font>

Administer lactulose, which traps ammonia in the gut and encourages the excretion of ammonia.

Additionally, administer rifaximin, an antibiotic that reduces the amount of ammonia-producing bacteria in the intestines

High levels of ammonia can lead to hepatic encephalopathy: a loss of brain function when a damaged liver doesn't remove toxins from the blood.
# <font color="#eedba7">How can you tell that a diuretic is working?</font>

Increased fluid output
Decreased weight
Electrolytes hover in normal levels
Lowered edema
# <font color="#eedba7">The hepatic portal pressure of a patient with cirrhosis is rising. This is an acute condition. How should we intervene?</font>

Administer an ordered octreotide and vasopressin to relieve hepatic portal pressure. Both of these medications are hormonal drugs that decrease the blood flow into the liver. They're used for acute instances for rapid response.

Beta blockers are used for long term management of hepatic portal pressure
# <font color="#eedba7">Give a summary of Hepatitis A</font>

A- from something you ATE

Ways to contract: Contaminated food or drinking water. It's also found on fecal matter and can be transmitted orally that way. 

Hepatitis A can range from mild to acute liver failure; it is only temporary and will go away on its own. It's highly infectious through fecal matter for 2 weeks before symptoms rise and even after jaundice goes away. Clay colored stool is to be expected as bilirubin will be impacted as well. 

Arthralgia (joint paint) may also be present as a symptom

Hepatitis A does not require isolation or contact precautions. Hand washing is the best prevention method. It also has a vaccine available. Practice standard hygiene to prevent spread.

# <font color="#eedba7">What are some ways that hepatitis B is transmitted?</font>

B - Blood (& bodily fluid)

Ways to contract: exposure to mucosal or body fluids of infectious blood and blood products. It can be either an acute or chronic disease.

# <font color="#eedba7">A patient has a question about post-operative care after a gallbladder removal/cholecystectomy. What is the patient education you give?</font>

After a LAPROSCOPIC surgery (90% of treatments, puncture holes), start on a clear liquid diet (at least for the first day) until solid food can be tolerated, light meals for several days, and restrict from fats for 2 weeks. 

After an INCISIONAL cholecystectomy, NPO until bowel sounds return, liquids and then regular diet, and restrict from fats for 4 to 6 weeks

Early ambulation, turn and cough; typical post-op abdominal surgery care
# <font color="#eedba7">What are some conditions that would cause difficulty in a patient to tolerate enteral nutrition?</font>

Infection

Refeeding syndrome (increased nutrition after a period of malnutrition; it shocks the body. Long-term TPN problem)

Metabolic problems that require high nutritional monitoring (Hypo/hyperglycemia, electrolyte, vitamin, trace mineral imbalances, hyperlipidemia)

Mechanical problems (air embolus, pneumothorax, hemorrhage, phlebitis, thrombosis, dislodgement, catheter malfunction)
# <font color="#eedba7">What type of electrolyte imbalance does pancreatitis cause?</font>

**!!! Hypocalcemia** (low calcium-- tetany, twitching, Chovotek's (contracting facial muscles) or Trousseau sign (carpal spasm))-- can be life threatening

Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol and triglycerides)
Hyperglycemia (high glucose)
Hypomagnesemia (high magnesium)
Hypokalemia (low potassium)
Hyponatremia (low sodium)

Patient may also experience elevated serum amylase/lipase (prominent and unique to pancreatitis)
# <font color="#eedba7">What is a unique physical assessment that pancreatitis leaves on the body?</font>

Crackles and tachypnea in the lungs
Cullen sign (C for central)
Grey Turner's sign (G for groin-- flank area)

![[Exam 3 STRESS-20240323230603865.webp|426]]
# <font color="#eedba7">What are some dietary teachings needed for a patient with pancreatitis and is being discharged home?</font>

Abstinence from alcohol, caffeine, and smoking

High carbohydrates (starchy vegetables, fruits with edible skin, beans & legumes)
High protein
Low fats (fats stimulate the pancreas)
# <font color="#eedba7">What is the diet of a patient who has had a gallbladder removal/cholecystectomy?</font>

After a LAPROSCOPIC surgery (90% of treatments, puncture holes), drink liquids only once a day, light meals for several days, and restrict from fats for 2 weeks. 

After an INCISIONAL cholecystectomy, NPO until bowel sounds return, liquids and then regular diet, and restrict from fats for 4 to 6 weeks
# <font color="#eedba7">What are characteristics of what you would expect from a biliary obstruction?</font>

Clay colored stools (no bile in small intestine)
Jaundice (bilirubin in skin)
Peritus (bile salts in skin)
Dark amber urine (bilirubin in urine)
Fatty food intolerance (no bile to digest fat)
Bleeding tendencies (lowered absorption of vitamin K)
Steatorrhea (fatty stool--no bile to digest fat in duodenum)

Increased bilirubin levels in the body ass it builds up in the blood
# <font color="#eedba7">A patient has ascites. How do you know if their condition is getting better?</font>

That the area of flooding reduces in size and water content
Decrease in weight
The patient reports less abdominal pain
Their output of fluids has increased
# <font color="#eedba7">How can you tell that a stoma is not healthy?</font>

It does not look bright and pink. A blue stoma-- or anything not red and beefy-- is an indicator of circular impairment
# <font color="#eedba7">A patient's appendix has ruptured. What is your immediate intervention?</font>

Start antibiotics. The patient is under immediate threat of peritonitis and sepsis needs to be prevented with the spilling of the appendix.

Emergency surgery is needed.
# <font color="#eedba7">A patient is involuntarily flapping their hands by the wrist. What is this condition called?</font>

It is asterixis; also called a flapping tremor or liver flap. It's an indicator that the liver is failing and is not de-toxifying ammonia in the body, which is now going to the brain.
# <font color="#eedba7">In Crohn's disease, it's common for the condition to cause fistulas. What are the complications of these fistulas?</font>

Fistulas are abnormal connections that form between different parts of the gastrointestinal tract. A huge complication is if the fistula makes an attachment from the intestine and to another organ or surface otherwise inappropriate for stool contamination. 

These usually need antibiotics and surgical intervention, though recurrence is very high, especially around surgical sites.
# <font color="#eedba7">What is the formula for an IV drip rate?</font>

IV Drip Rate (gtt/min) = Total Volume (mL)/Time (min) x Drop Factor (gtt/mL)

Sample:
A patient is to receive 1 L of Hartmann’s solution over the next 12 hours. What is the rate of infusion in drops per minute (dpm), if the drop factor is 60 drops per mL.

Volume = 1 000 mL, since 1 L = 1 000 mL. 
Time = 720 mins (12 hr)
Drop Factor = 60 drops per mL.

1,000 mL / 720 mins * 60 = 83.333 or 83 drops/min
# <font color="#eedba7">Unique clinical manifestations of Crohn's Disease compared to Ulcerative Colitis</font>

Can manifest on any segment of the GI tract: mouth to anus

Skip lesions. There can be healthy tissue between areas of inflammation, creating a patchy pattern of inflammation

Fistulas can create abnormal connections between different parts of the digestive tract. These formations can lead to pockets of pus.

Crohn's Disease most commonly involves the perianal area; this is not a typical manifestation for ulcerative colitis
# <font color="#eedba7">Unique clinical manifestations in ulcerative colitis compared to Crohn's disease</font>

Primarily affects the colon and the rectum

Inflammation affects the innermost lining (mucosa) of the colon and the rectum
# <font color="#eedba7">What is a normal range of WBC?</font>

4,500 to 11,000 per microliter
# <font color="#eedba7">What are the complications of peptic ulcer disease?</font>

Hemorrhage - very common complication; erosion of ulcer. The duodenal is more likely to bleed

Perforation - HIGHLY LETHAL; the ulcer penetrates the serosal surface and spills gastic/duodenal contents into the peritoneal cavity. I**f left untreated, bacterial peritonitis may occur within 6 to 12 hours and may lead to sepsis**. Large perforations need immediate surgery.

Gastric Outlet Obstruction - Obstruction due to inflammation, fibrous scar tissue, edema, pylorospasm, any contributor to the narrowing of the pylorus. The stomach dialates
