- **GOUT** <font color="#c00000">(Ch.34)</font>
	- Simple Nursing
	- ? What is gout and what causes it?
		- A type of arthritis characterized by [[hyperuricemia]] and the deposition of uric acid crystals in one or more joints. The uric sodium crystals may be in artiuclar, periarticular, and subcutaneous tissues
		- It has painful flares for days to weeks, then long asymptomatic periods
		- It occurs when kidneys can't excrete enough or if too much waste is being made. Kidney malfunction can be caused by metabolic syndromes, increased intake of high purine foods, prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol
	- ? What is the process of gout and how it develops?
		- Two processes much occur: crystallization and inflammation and tissue damage in one or more joints
		- Most commonly fount in the great toe, secondary to wrists, knees, ankles, mid fold, elbow. Other tender spots.
		- It can be triggered by trauma, surgery, alcohol, or systemic infections

		- A slow but progressive non-flammatory disorder of synovial joints. It is the gradual loss of articular cartilage beginning from 20 and 30, with symptoms manifesting after 50 - 60
		- The once smooth cartilage becomes dull, yellow, granular with an overgrowth of bone (osteophytes). It causes uneven joint surfaces. The synovial joints are softer and less elastic, cracked and worn. It can resist less wear with heavy use

- **DEGENERATIVE DISC DISEASE** <font color="#f145d2">(Ch.65)</font>
	- Simple Nursing
	- What is degenerative disc disease and what causes it?
		- Spinal disc herniation, deterioration, or other disc dysfunctions. It can effect the cervical, thoracic, and lumber spine. It occurs due to age or trauma. 
		- Radiculopathy produces pain and continued pressure may produce degenerative changes in the nerves.
		- Continued pressure may produce degenerative changes in the nerves with resultant changes in sensation and motor responces
		- Surgery may be needed, but primary treatment is rest

	- What are the surgeries available for intervertebral disc disease?
		- Laminectomy - Surgically remove a disc through excision of part of the vertebra
		- Diskectomy - Surgically decompresses nerve root; microsurgical or precutaneous technique
		- Artificial disc replacement - Restores movement, eliminate pain
		- Spinal fusion: for unstable spine, it's an artifical connection of contiguous vertebrae. It uses a bone graft from a patient's fibula/iliax crease or donated bone. It can have a metal fixation to add stability.

	- ? What are signs and symptoms of Parkingsons?
		- TRAP - Tremor, rigidity, akinesia, postural instability
		- Early stages - mild tremor, slight limp, decreased arm swing
		- Later stages - shuffling, propulsive ait with arms flexed, loss of posture, balance. 90% experience hypokinetic dysarthia (speech abnormality)
		- Bradykinesia - slowing of initiation/execution of movement. It can also be the loss of autonomic movements, loss of blinking, masked face, swallowing of saliva (drooling)
		- Constipation/urinary retention
		- Apathy
