	- ? What is the pancreas?
		- Exocrine production; it helps with digestion with pancreatic juice. It breaks down carbs, fats, enzymes. Endocrine aids in regulation of blood sugar
	- ? What is the biliary tract/tree?
		- System of vessels that direct the digestive secretions from the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas into the duodenum. The exit hole into the duodenum is called the ampulla of vater.
	- ? What is bile and bilirubin?
		- Bilirubin is the product of RBC breakdown and it is excreted in bile. Bile is released from the liver and delivered to the intestine via depatic duct. 
		- Biliary tract disease interrupts this process.
	- ? What is acute and chronic pancreatitis and what causes it?
		- The autodigestion of the pancreas by pancreatic enzymes. It can be mild edema to severe necrosis. The severity depends on the extent of pancreatic destruction.
		- The pancreatic enzymes are active inside of the pancreas instead of outside of it and in the intestine; this damage the pancreas.
	- ? What are signs and symptoms of pancreatitis?
		- Severe and sudden onset of abdominal pain
		- LUQ to Mid-epigastric; it radiates to the back
		- Severe, deep, piercing, steady
		- ! Aggravated by eating 
		- Not relieved by vomitting
		- Tenderness and guarding with palpation
		- Typical abdominal obstruction symptoms
		- Edema
		- With lung involvement:
		  Cyanosis
		  Dyspnea
		  Crackles in lungs
		- Jaundice
	- ? What are some symptoms of pancreatitis that will be visible to a nurse performing a physical exam?
		- Discoloration of the abdominal wall related to bloodstained exudate seepage from the pancrease
		- Cullen's sign - bluish periumbulical discoloration
		- Grey Turner's sign - bluish flank discoloration
		- Pseudocysts - cavities outside of the pancreas filled with necrotic products
		- Abscess
		- Abdominal distention or tenderness
		- Plumonary manifestations (crackles, tachypnea)
	- ? What are the risk factors for pancreatitis?
		- ! ALCOHOLISM
		- Men are more prone
		- ! Middle age
		- ! Having biliary tract disease
		- [[Hypertriglyceridemia]]
		- Smoking
		- Less common causes:
		  Post surgical abdominal truama
		  Viral infection
		  Penetrating duodenal ulcer
		  Cysts, abscess
		  Drugs (steroids, thiazide, diuretics, NSAIDS, sulfa)
	- ? What is a mild case of acute pancreatitis?
		- It's mild
		- Causes edema or interstitial
		- Typically self-limiting to the pancreas
	- ? What is a severe case of pancreatitis?
		- It's necrotizing
		- Risk for developing pancreatic necrosis, multi-organ failure, sepsis
		- 25% mortality rate
	- ? What are complications for pancreatitis?
		- Leakage of the pancreatic enzymes from an auto-digested pancreas can cause peritonitis
		- The inflammatory response can pull so much plasma from the blood and trigger [[hypovolemia]]
		- Blood and pancreatic fluid escape into abdominal cavity, which decreases blood volume and results in a large drop in blood pressure
	- ? What are some lab results you would expect to see in a patient with pancreatitis?
		- ! Serum amylase :luc_arrow_big_up: and serum lipase :luc_arrow_big_up:(most important tests)
		- Blood glucose :luc_arrow_big_up:
		- Triglycerides :luc_arrow_big_up:
		- Liver enzymes :luc_arrow_big_up:
		- Bilirubin :luc_arrow_big_up:
		- ! Serum Ca :luc_arrow_big_down:
	- ? How would you be able to diagnose for pancreatitis?
		- ! Contract-enhance CT scan
		- ! ERCP (endoscopic ultrasound)
		- Abdominal/endoscopic ultrasound
		- Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
		- Chest x-ray (atelectasis, pleural effusions)
	- ? How do you treat for pancreatitis?
		- Prioritize pain management
		- Prevent/alleviate shock
		- Correct fluid/electrolyte imbalance
		- Prevention/treatment of infection
		- Removal of precipitating cause
		- TPN, PATIENT IS NPO
		- In conservative therapy, this is a more intense therapy for pancreatitis control. It includes aggressive hydration and minimizing pancreas stimulation (NPO, NG to suction, enteral nutrition). The leading cause of mortality of pancreatitis is infection.
		- Early ambulation
		- ! Dietary teaching - high carb, low fat (fat stimulates the pancreas), high protein. Fruit high in carb, vegetables, whole grains, beans and legeumes. 
		- Patient teaching of abstinence from alcohol, caffeine, and smoking
- ⭐ **PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE (Ch.40)**
	- CHECK FOR GAG REFLEX TO PREVENT ASPIRATION
	- What is peptic ulcer disease?
		- Erosion of the GI mucosa resulting from digestive action of HCl acid and pepsin. This ulcer formation can occur in any portion of the GI tract that comes to contact with gastric secretion.
		- The site of the ulcer will effect the risk factors stemming from the ulcer location.
	- What are the differences of acute and chronic peptic ulcer disease?
		- Acute:
		  Superficial erosion, minimal inflammation, short duration and resolves quickly when the cause is identified and removed.
		- Chronic:
		  Muscular wall erosion; formation of fibrous tissue (scarring). Long duration: months or intermittently
		  More common than acute.
		- 
	- What can destroy the mucosal barrier?
		- Helicobacter pylori - destroys tissue and increases risk of ulcer formation
		- Asprin and NSAIDS - increases gastric secretion and decreases integrity of mucosal barrier
		- Corticosteroids, anticoagulants, SSRIs: increase of ulcer development
		- Lifestyle factors - alcohol, coffee, smoking, psychological stress, depression
	- What are signs and symptoms
	- What are the risk factors for GASTRIC peptic ulcer disease?
		- Occurs most commonly in the antrum portion of the GI
		- Being a woman
		- Being >50
		- More likely to appear than duodenal ulcers and can result in obstruction, hemorrhage, and perforation
		- Smoking and alcohol
		- Some medications can make ulcers more prone to appearing
		- Bile reflux
		- H. pylori
	- What are the risk factors for DUODENAL peptic ulcer disease?
		- 80%~ of all peptic ulcers will be in the duodenal
		- This can occur at any age, but is most prone between 35 and 45 years
		- Associated with increase of HCl acid secretion
		- H. pylori found in 90% to 95% of cases (not all H.pylori carriers will develop ulcers)
	- Which patients are most negatively effected by duodenal ulcers?
		- COPD
		- Cirrhosis of liver
		- Chronic pancreaitis
		- Hyperparathyroidism
		- Chronic renal failure
		- Zollinger-Ellison syndrone (tumor of he pancreas)
		- Smoking and alcohol use
