**Comprehensive Study Guide for HESI Review: Maternal/OB Nursing**

---

**I. Must-Know Topics for Maternal/OB HESI**

---

**1. Antepartum Care**

- **Physiological Changes in Pregnancy**

- **Cardiovascular:** Increased blood volume by 40-50%, increased cardiac output, physiological anemia.
- **Respiratory:** Increased oxygen demand, diaphragmatic elevation, mild hyperventilation.
- **Renal:** Increased GFR, risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs).
- **Endocrine:** Placental hormones (hCG, progesterone, estrogen), insulin resistance (risk of gestational diabetes).
- **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, pyrosis (heartburn).

- **Fetal Development and Milestones**

- Week 4: Heart begins to beat.
- Week 12: Gender can be identified.
- Week 20: Quickening (fetal movement).
- Week 28: Surfactant production begins.
- Week 36: Full lung maturation.

- **Prenatal Testing**

- **Routine labs:** Blood type, Rh factor, CBC, rubella titer, hepatitis B.
- **First trimester:** Ultrasound for dating, nuchal translucency.
- **Second trimester:** Quad screen, anatomy ultrasound.
- **Third trimester:** Group B strep (GBS), non-stress test (NST), contraction stress test (CST).

- **Danger Signs in Pregnancy**

- Vaginal bleeding (placenta previa, abruptio placentae).
- Severe headaches or vision changes (preeclampsia).
- Decreased fetal movement.

**2. Labor and Birth Process**

- **Stages of Labor**

- **Stage 1:** Cervical dilation and effacement.

- Latent phase: 0-3 cm, mild contractions.
- Active phase: 4-7 cm, regular contractions.
- Transition phase: 8-10 cm, intense contractions.

- **Stage 2:** Delivery of the baby.
- **Stage 3:** Delivery of the placenta.
- **Stage 4:** Immediate postpartum recovery.

- **Fetal Monitoring**

- **Baseline FHR:** 110-160 bpm.
- **Variability:** Moderate is reassuring.
- **Decelerations:**

- Early: Normal, caused by head compression.
- Late: Uteroplacental insufficiency, requires intervention.
- Variable: Cord compression, requires repositioning.

- **Pain Management**

- Non-pharmacologic: Breathing techniques, massage, hydrotherapy.
- Pharmacologic: Epidurals (monitor for hypotension), opioids (monitor for neonatal respiratory depression).

- **Complications in Labor**

- **Shoulder Dystocia:** "Turtle sign," use McRoberts maneuver, suprapubic pressure.
- **Cord Prolapse:** Trendelenburg or knee-chest position, emergency cesarean.
- **Uterine Rupture:** Sudden pain, loss of FHR, prepare for surgery.

**3. Postpartum Care**

- **Physical Changes**

- Uterine involution: Fundus descends 1 cm/day.
- Lochia stages: Rubra (1-3 days), serosa (4-10 days), alba (10-14 days).
- Breast changes: Engorgement, mastitis prevention.

- **Emotional Adaptation**

- Baby blues (common, mild).
- Postpartum depression: Requires treatment.
- Postpartum psychosis: Emergency intervention needed.

- **Complications**

- Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH): Causes include uterine atony, retained placenta.
- Thrombophlebitis: Increased clotting factors postpartum increase risk.

**4. Newborn Care**

- **APGAR Scoring** (performed at 1 and 5 minutes):

- Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration.
- Score 7-10: Normal; <7: Requires resuscitation.

- **Common Newborn Conditions**

- **Jaundice:** Physiological (after 24 hours) vs. pathological (within 24 hours).
- **Hypoglycemia:** Common in infants of diabetic mothers (monitor glucose levels).
- **Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS):** Preterm infants, treat with surfactant.

---

**II. Case Studies and Practice Scenarios**

---

**Case Study 1: Preeclampsia**  
**Scenario:**  
A 28-year-old pregnant client at 34 weeks presents with a blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg, proteinuria, and complaints of severe headaches and epigastric pain.

- **Questions:**

- What condition does the client have?
- What are the priority nursing interventions?

**Answer:**

- Condition: Severe preeclampsia.
- Nursing interventions:

- Administer antihypertensives as prescribed.
- Start IV magnesium sulfate for seizure prevention.
- Monitor for signs of magnesium toxicity (e.g., decreased DTRs, respiratory depression).
- Prepare for possible preterm delivery.

---

**Case Study 2: Labor Complications**  
**Scenario:**  
A client in active labor at 8 cm dilated has late decelerations on the fetal monitor.

- **Questions:**

- What could be causing the late decelerations?
- What should the nurse do?

**Answer:**

- Cause: Uteroplacental insufficiency.
- Nursing actions:

- Reposition the client (left side).
- Administer oxygen via face mask.
- Stop oxytocin if infusing.
- Notify the healthcare provider.

---

**III. NCLEX-Style Practice Questions**

---

**1. Antepartum NCLEX-Style Question:**  
A pregnant client at 20 weeks reports mild cramping and dark red spotting. Which actions should the nurse prioritize?

- A. Assess fetal heart tones with a Doppler.
- B. Prepare for an emergency cesarean section.
- C. Instruct the client to keep a record of fetal movements.
- D. Place the client on bedrest.

**Correct Answer:** A. Assess fetal heart tones with a Doppler.  
**Rationale:** Assessing fetal viability is the priority. Dark red spotting could indicate a placental problem, and bedrest may be recommended after evaluation.

---

**2. Postpartum NCLEX-Style Question:**  
The nurse is caring for a client 2 hours postpartum. Which findings would require immediate intervention?

- A. Fundus is firm and midline.
- B. Lochia saturates a pad in 15 minutes.
- C. Blood pressure is 140/80 mmHg.
- D. Client reports mild perineal pain.

**Correct Answer:** B. Lochia saturates a pad in 15 minutes.  
**Rationale:** Saturating a pad that quickly indicates possible postpartum hemorrhage, which is a priority.

---

**3. Newborn NCLEX-Style Question:**  
A newborn has an APGAR score of 6 at 1 minute. What interventions should the nurse perform?

- A. Suction the airway as needed.
- B. Administer oxygen via mask.
- C. Begin chest compressions.
- D. Reassess the APGAR score at 5 minutes.

**Correct Answers:** A, B, D.  
**Rationale:** Suction and oxygen are necessary for mild to moderate distress. Chest compressions are not indicated unless the heart rate is below 60 bpm.

---

**IV. Study Resources**

---

1. **Recommended Books**

- _HESI Comprehensive Review for the NCLEX-RN Examination_ (by Elsevier).
- _Maternity and Women’s Health Care_ (by Lowdermilk et al.).
- _Saunders Comprehensive Review for the NCLEX-RN_ (by Linda Silvestri).

3. **Digital Study Tools**

- _UWorld NCLEX-RN_: Detailed question rationales.
- _Picmonic_: Visual learning aids for pregnancy milestones and complications.

5. **Flashcards**

- Create or use pre-made flashcards for prenatal labs, medications (e.g., oxytocin, magnesium sulfate), and fetal monitoring.

---

**V. Test-Taking Tips for Maternal/OB HESI**

---

1. **Prioritize Safety:**

- Use the _ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation)_ framework.

3. **Focus on the Nursing Process:**

- Assess before intervening unless the question states assessment data.

5. **Remember Key Values:**

- FHR: 110-160 bpm.
- Fundus location: Midline and firm postpartum.

7. **SATA Question Strategy:**

- Treat each option as true/false. Select only those directly supported by the question.
