	* <span style="background:#fff88f">Prevention is key.</span> <span style="background:#fff88f">Primary prevention</span> (condoms, vaccinations, protection) are direct ways to prevent STIs and is a way to completely avoid STIs. <span style="background:#fff88f">Secondary prevention </span>is to get a diagnosis or screening for suspicion of an STI; you're treating an infection that may already exist. <span style="background:#fff88f">T</span><span style="background:#fff88f">etriary prevention</span> is to manage an existing disease and to slow down its progression.

Even if the patient is allergic to penicillin, they will be treated with penicillin as they tolerate it.</span>
	* If you see signs of syphilis holes, and the patient says that it doesn't hurt, chances are that it is indeed syphilis.
	* <span style="background:#fff88f">Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is female-only inflammatory disorder of the upper genital tract.</span> Multiple organisms can cause this.

	* <span style="background:#fff88f">The sole reason why people are unable to get the help they need is because of stigma against mental illness. </span>
	* Three types of stigma are experienced: 1.) public, 2.) self-stigma, 3.) label avoidance.
	* Public stigma - sterotypes of being incapable of functioning independently. Sometimes it is treated as if the person is responsible for their disability. Media perpetuates stigma.
