Tardive dyskinesia is a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive body movements, often resulting from long-term use of certain medications.

**Causes:**
- Most commonly caused by long-term use of antipsychotic medications, particularly first-generation (typical) antipsychotics, which block dopamine receptors in the brain.
- Can also occur with long-term use of some second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics, although the risk is generally lower.

**Signs and Symptoms:**
- Involuntary movements, often involving the face, such as:
    - Grimacing
    - Tongue protrusion
    - Lip smacking or puckering
    - Rapid eye blinking
- Movements can also affect the limbs and trunk, causing:
    - Finger movements
    - Hand clenching
    - Foot tapping
- Symptoms may be mild or severe and can be socially stigmatizing and physically disabling.

**Treatment:**
1. **Medication Adjustments:**
    - Consider reducing the dose of the causative medication or switching to a different antipsychotic with a lower risk of TD.
2. **Medications Specifically for TD:**
    - **[[Valbenazine]] (Ingrezza):** A VMAT2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of TD.
    - **[[Deutetrabenazine]] ([[Austedo]]):** Another VMAT2 inhibitor used to manage TD symptoms.
3. **Supportive Therapies:**
    - Speech and physical therapy may help improve function and communication.
4. **Monitoring and Prevention:**
    - Regular monitoring for early signs of TD in patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.
    - Using the lowest effective dose of antipsychotics and considering atypical antipsychotics to minimize the risk.

**Prognosis:**
- Symptoms may persist even after discontinuation of the causative medication, but early detection and treatment can improve outcomes.
