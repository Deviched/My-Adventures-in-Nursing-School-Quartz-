- **Agranulocytosis:** A serious condition characterized by a markedly reduced number of granulocytes, a type of white blood cell that includes neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. Neutrophils are particularly important for fighting infections.
### What It Does
- **Increased Infection Risk:** The significant reduction in neutrophils severely compromises the immune system, leaving the body vulnerable to infections. Patients may experience frequent, severe, or unusual infections.
- **Symptoms:** Common symptoms include sudden fever, chills, sore throat, weakness, fatigue, and mouth ulcers. Infections can occur in any part of the body, such as the skin, throat, or urinary tract.
### Causes
- **Medications:** Certain drugs are known to cause agranulocytosis, including:
    - **Antipsychotics:** [[Clozapine]] is a well-known antipsychotic associated with agranulocytosis.
    - **Antibiotics:** Some antibiotics, like sulfonamides and chloramphenicol, can cause this condition.
    - **Antithyroid Drugs:** Medications such as methimazole and propylthiouracil.
    - **Antiepileptics:** Certain drugs used for epilepsy.
- **Autoimmune Disorders:** Conditions where the body's immune system attacks its own cells can lead to agranulocytosis.
- **Bone Marrow Diseases:** Disorders affecting the bone marrow, such as aplastic anemia or leukemia, can result in reduced production of granulocytes.
- **Infections:** Some viral infections can temporarily suppress bone marrow function.
### Diagnosis
- **Blood Tests:** A complete blood count (CBC) will reveal low levels of neutrophils (neutropenia).
- **Bone Marrow Biopsy:** In some cases, a biopsy may be needed to determine the cause.
### Treatment
1. **Discontinuation of Offending Drug:** If a medication is identified as the cause, it should be stopped immediately.
2. **Infection Management:** Prompt treatment of infections with appropriate antibiotics or antifungal medications is crucial.
3. **Supportive Care:** Hospitalization may be necessary for severe cases to provide supportive care, including isolation to prevent infections.
4. **Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF):** Medications like filgrastim can be used to stimulate the production of white blood cells in the bone marrow.
5. **Regular Monitoring:** Frequent monitoring of blood cell counts is essential to track recovery and adjust treatments as needed.

### Prevention
- **Monitoring:** Regular blood tests for patients on medications known to cause agranulocytosis can help detect the condition early.
- **Patient Education:** Informing patients about the symptoms of agranulocytosis can lead to early detection and treatment.
