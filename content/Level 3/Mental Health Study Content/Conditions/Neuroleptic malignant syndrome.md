- **!!Life-threatening!!** Discontinue offending antipsychotic ASAP
- **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):** A rare, life-threatening condition associated with the use of antipsychotic medications.
### Etiology
- **Cause:** Typically occurs after the initiation or increase in dosage of neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs, especially first-generation antipsychotics, but can occur with any antipsychotic.
### Pathophysiology
- **Mechanism:** Believed to result from dopamine receptor blockade in the central nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus and basal ganglia. With increased dose of antipsychotic, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the blocked dopamine receptors start to block basic and necessary bodily function as well</span>.
### Clinical Features
1. **Hyperthermia:** Elevated body temperature, often exceeding 38°C (100.4°F).
2. **Muscle Rigidity:** Severe muscle stiffness.
3. **Autonomic Dysfunction:** Includes symptoms like unstable blood pressure, tachycardia, and diaphoresis.
4. **Altered Mental Status:** Confusion, delirium, or coma.
5. YourBestGrade Rationale:
	1. **Acute renal failure** may occur in NMS due to dehydration and rhabdomyolysis. Muscle rigidity and hyperthermia contribute to muscle damage, as seen by the client's elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. This can quickly progress to rhabdomyolysis, as the damaged skeletal muscle breaks down and releases substances like CK and myoglobin into the bloodstream. Elevated levels of myoglobin can be assessed through the blood and urine and contribute to renal failure.
	2. **Cardiac arrhythmias** and cardiac arrest are potential complications of NMS due to electrolyte abnormalities, specifically hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Further, lithium and ziprasidone are medications that can prolong the QT interval.
	3. **Seizures** can develop in clients with NMS if the associated hyperthermia and hyponatremia are not promptly corrected.
	4. **Respiratory failure** can result from chest wall rigidity or a pulmonary embolism from the

complication of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), causing microvascular

thrombi in the organs.
### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis:** Based on the presentation of symptoms and recent history of antipsychotic use.
- **Laboratory Findings:** Elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, leukocytosis, and possible electrolyte imbalances.
### Differential Diagnosis
- **Conditions to Rule Out:** Malignant hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, heat stroke, infections, and other causes of altered mental status and hyperthermia.
### Management
1. **Immediate Discontinuation:** Stop the offending neuroleptic drug.
2. **Supportive Care:** Hydration, cooling measures, and monitoring of vital signs.
3. **Medications:**
    - **Dantrolene:** Muscle relaxant that may be used to treat severe cases.
    - **Bromocriptine:** Dopamine agonist that can help reverse dopamine blockade.
4. **Intensive Care:** In severe cases, patients may require intensive care unit (ICU) admission for closer monitoring and management.
### Prognosis
- **Recovery:** Most patients recover with appropriate treatment, but the condition can be fatal if not recognized and managed promptly.
### Prevention
- **Careful Monitoring:** Regular monitoring when initiating or increasing doses of antipsychotics.
- **Patient Education:** Inform patients and caregivers about the symptoms of NMS.
### Risk Factors
- **High Potency Antipsychotics:** More common with high potency first-generation antipsychotics.
- **Rapid Dose Escalation:** Increasing doses too quickly.
- **Dehydration and Exhaustion:** These can increase the risk of developing NMS.
